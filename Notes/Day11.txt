Expanding the space:
First, find out which columns and rows are empty.
For every empty column or row, a new empty column or row will be added adjacent to it.
The new column will be placed to the right of the empty column, and the new row will be placed below the empty row.

Finding the shortest paths between galaxies:
First, find the location of every galaxy
Next, create a SET of galaxy pairs. Identical pairs will be filtered out.
For each pair, return the straight-line distance between the galaxies.
The solution is the sum of distances.
