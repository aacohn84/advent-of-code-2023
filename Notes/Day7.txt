How to rank the hands for day 7?

I feel like it would be great if we could map the ranking to a number for easy comparisons. That way if we have to rank
hands against each other, it's super easy, you just sort them by the numerical value.

How can we assign scores to the hands? There are 5 cards per hand, and there are 7 types of hand you can have.

So here's an idea: we have 5 cards per hand. For each card, we'll assign a value. Then we'll multiply that value by 13 to the power of its order in the hand. Finally, we have a value for the hand type, which is multiplied by the highest power of 13.

So the card values would be:
A = 13
K = 12
Q = 11
J = 10
T = 9
9 = 8
8 = 7
7 = 6
6 = 5
5 = 4
4 = 3
3 = 2
2 = 1

For any 5-card hand, we will find its rank by the following formula:
V = handRank * 13^5 + 1st * 13^4 + 2nd * 13^3 + 3rd * 13^2 + (4th * 13) + 5th

Hand rankings:
6 Five of a kind
5 Four of a kind
4 Full house
3 Three of a kind
2 Two pair
1 One pair
0 High card

So, for example, five of a kind with all aces would be:
V = 6 * 13^5 + 13 * 13^4 + 13 * 13^3 + 13 * 13^2 + 13 * 13 + 13 = 2629991

If we compared that to five of a kind with the last card as a king, the value would be 3001283, so the first hand would win.

One pair, even if it's the lowest possible pair, should still beat the highest possible high card hand.
V(22345) = 13^5 + 1 * 13^4 + 1 * 13^3 + 2 * 13^2 + 3 * 13 + 4 = 402432
V(A,K,Q,J,T) = 13 * 13^4 + 12 * 13^3 + 11 * 13^2 + 10 * 13 + 9 = 399655
